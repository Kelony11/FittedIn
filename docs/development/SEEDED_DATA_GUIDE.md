# Viewing Seeded Data Guide

This guide explains how to view and interact with the fake data generated by the database seeding script.

## Quick Start

1. **Seed the database:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run db:seed:faker
   ```

2. **Login with any seeded user:**
   - Email: Use any email from seeded users (e.g., check pgAdmin or try common patterns)
   - Password: `Password123!` (same for all seeded users)

3. **Explore the data:**
   - Dashboard: See your profile, goals stats, and recent activity
   - Goals page: View all your goals with progress tracking
   - Posts feed: See posts from you and other users
   - Connections: Browse connections and discover new users

## Finding Seeded User Emails

### Option 1: Using pgAdmin
1. Open `http://localhost:5050`
2. Connect to the database
3. Browse the `users` table
4. Copy any email address

### Option 2: Using SQL
```bash
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d fittedin_dev -c "SELECT email, display_name FROM users LIMIT 10;"
```

### Option 3: Check Seeding Output
The seeding script displays progress. User emails follow the pattern: `firstname.lastname@example.com`

## What You'll See After Login

### Dashboard (`/dashboard.html`)
- **User Info**: Your display name and profile completion
- **Profile Preview**: Location, fitness level
- **Goals Stats**: Total goals, completed goals, active goals
- **Recent Activity**: Progress updates on your goals
- **Community Feed**: Posts and activities from connections

### Goals Page (`/goals.html`)
- **All Your Goals**: Created by the seeding script (1-5 goals per user)
- **Progress Tracking**: Current vs target values with progress bars
- **Goal Categories**: Weight loss, cardio, muscle gain, etc.
- **Goal Status**: Active, completed, paused, or cancelled

### Posts Feed (on Dashboard)
- **Posts from Connections**: You'll see posts from users you have **accepted connections** with
- **Your Own Posts**: Your posts also appear in your feed
- **Likes and Comments**: Interactions on posts from your connections
- **Activity Updates**: Goal completions and progress updates

**Important**: The feed only shows posts from users you're connected with (accepted status). Since 70% of seeded connections are accepted, most users will see posts from multiple other users in their feed.

### Connections Page (`/connections.html`)
- **Your Connections**: Accepted connections with other users
- **Pending Requests**: Sent and received connection requests
- **User Discovery**: Search and discover other users

### Profile Page (`/profile.html`)
- **Complete Profile**: Bio, location, fitness level, skills
- **Physical Info**: Height, weight, date of birth
- **Goals Preview**: Your wellness goals
- **Skills**: Wellness skills you've added

## Data Characteristics

### Users
- **50 users** by default (configurable)
- Realistic names and emails
- Complete profiles with bios, locations, fitness levels
- Random avatar URLs

### Goals
- **1-5 goals per user**
- Various categories: weight loss, cardio, muscle gain, etc.
- Realistic progress values (some completed, some in progress)
- Target dates and milestones

### Posts
- **150 posts** by default
- Fitness-themed content
- Distributed across users
- Likes and comments

### Connections
- **100 connections** by default
- **70% are accepted connections** - This ensures users can see each other's posts in their feed
- Remaining 30% are pending, rejected, or blocked
- No self-connections

### Activities
- **200 activities** by default
- Goal updates, profile changes, connection events
- Linked to related entities

### Notifications
- **150 notifications** by default
- Connection requests, post likes, goal milestones
- Some marked as read

## Tips for Testing

1. **Login as Different Users**: Each user has different data, so try multiple accounts
2. **Check Your Feed**: After login, check the dashboard feed - you should see posts from your accepted connections
3. **Explore Connections**: Go to Connections page to see who you're connected with
4. **Discover New Users**: Use the "Discover" tab to search and connect with other users
5. **Auto-Accept Feature**: When you send a connection request to a seeded user (email ends with `@fittedin-seeded.com`), it's automatically accepted! No need to wait.
6. **Explore Goals**: Goals have various progress levels - some are nearly complete
7. **View Profiles**: Click "View Profile" on any user card to see their public profile
8. **Test Interactions**: Like posts, send connection requests, update goal progress
9. **Accept More Connections**: Accept pending requests to see more posts in your feed

## Auto-Accept Feature

**Important**: Seeded users (fake users created by the seeding script) automatically accept all connection requests! This means:

- When you send a request to a seeded user, it's immediately accepted
- You can immediately see their posts in your feed
- No need to wait for manual acceptance

Seeded users are identified by their email domain: `@fittedin-seeded.com`

For more details, see [Auto-Accept Connections Documentation](../features/AUTO_ACCEPT_CONNECTIONS.md).

## Customizing Seeded Data

You can customize the amount of data generated:

```bash
# More users and posts
SEED_NUM_USERS=100 SEED_NUM_POSTS=300 npm run db:seed:faker

# Clear existing data first
SEED_CLEAR=true npm run db:seed:faker
```

See [SEEDING_README.md](../../backend/scripts/SEEDING_README.md) for all configuration options.

## Troubleshooting

### "No data showing after login"
- Ensure the seeding script completed successfully
- Check that you're logged in with a seeded user (not a newly created account)
- Verify the database has data: `docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d fittedin_dev -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"`

### "Can't find user emails"
- Use pgAdmin to browse the users table
- Or run: `docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d fittedin_dev -c "SELECT email FROM users LIMIT 10;"`

### "Password doesn't work"
- All seeded users have password: `Password123!`
- Make sure you're using the exact email from the database

## Next Steps

After exploring the seeded data:
1. Try creating your own goals
2. Send connection requests to other users
3. Create posts and interact with the feed
4. Update your profile information
5. Track progress on your goals
